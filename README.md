DAY 2

- Task distribution
- I got “Vedic” and “Kannada” webpages to analyze.

1. KANNADA

- Significance –
  - This page contains Kannada, Hindi and English alphabets.
  - Helps to learn alphabets of Hindi, Kannada and English language.
  - Helps to find equivalent alphabets of two different languages.

Eg: Hindi to English, Kannada to Hindi.

- - Equivalency is based on sound of alphabets.
    - Works mainly for Kannada to Hindi and vice-versa conversion.
    - English is just to visualize, properly understand sound of the alphabet and how to pronounce the alphabets.

Eg: **क (Hindi) - Kha (English)**

- Elements-
  - Page contains a toggle button to select language (Hindi or Kannada).
  - “?” button gives the information about what the page does.
  - Two drop-downs-
    - First is used to select the Primary language.
    - Second is used to select which is equivalent to the primary language.
  - Under the drop-downs webpage contains the alphabets in a “grid” based layout.

This section is further divided into two sub sections –

- - - VOWELS **(स्वर)**

Contains all the vowels of both the selected language in grid-based layout where one vowel (both languages) is represented by a ‘CARD’.

- - - CONSONANTS **(व्यंजन)**

Contains all the consonants of both the selected language in grid-based layout where one consonant (both language) is represented by a ‘CARD’.

- - Cards-
        - Contains Hower effect.
        - Shadows are integrated to make it visually appealing.
- Positives-
  - Color selection is fine. (could be improved)
  - Design is also fine. (could be improved)
  - Idea of grid-based layout was fabulous.
  - Drop-down is placed fine.
  - “?” does help the user but could be more elaborative.
- Improvements that need to handled-
  - Toggle button is just there-

All it does is to select the primary language (Hindi or Kannada), which can be sone by drop-downs easily.

It does not provide any unique functionality to the website.
- - Using drop-down you can select same language as both primary and secondary.
    - A little designing error-
      - Here consonants hold the color scheme of “CYAN” where “**CONSONANTS (व्यंजन)**” has font color cyan and the “**shadow of the cards”** is also of cyan color which is right.
      - Now in vowels section we have a minor issue-

“**VOWELS (स्वर)**” has font color cyan and “**shadow of the cards”** is of blue color.

1. **VEDIC**

- Significance –
  - This page contains Vedic Time Units.
  - Helps to learn about Vedic Time Units and their English Time unit equivalents.

Eg: क्षण ≈ 🕛1 seconds or⏳0.017 minutes or 📅0 years

- - Primary task of this webpage is to provide an easy-to-use VEDIC UNIT CONVERTOR
    - Converts the user provided value from one unit to another.
- Elements-
  - Section 1- Contains a Vedic Unit Converter created using JavaScript’s inner HTML property.
    - Enter the number in “Enter value” input box.
    - Select the primary unit using “From” drop-down.
    - Select the secondary unit you want to convert to using” To” drop-down.
  - Section 2 – Contains 12 Vedic Time unit.
    - This section Contains 12 Vedic time unit and their English Time Unit equivalents.
    - Every unit is represented by card and cards are laid out in a grid layout.
- Positives-
  - Color selection is fine. (could be improved)
  - Design is also fine. (could be improved)
  - Idea of grid-based layout was fabulous.
  - Converter works fine.
  - Way of representing different Units using grid and scrollable design is good too.
  - Idea of providing three English unit equivalents was great too.
- Improvements that need to handled-
  - Unit converter accepts the negative values too which is logically not correct.
  - When user select very small primary unit with respect to secondary unit the converter gives the result zero (0) instead of correct value.
  - In section 2 where units are present unit name is only present in Hindi to make it bit easier, we can also provide the pronunciation in English too.
